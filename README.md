# 🏆 Kaggle Competitions

Welcome to my Kaggle competitions repo! This is where I explore, experiment, and learn through various data science challenges hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## 📊 Current Project

### 🚢 Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
My first dive into Kaggle! The goal of this classic beginner competition is to predict survival outcomes based on passenger data from the Titanic.

- 🧠 Focus: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and basic classification models.
- 🛠️ Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks.
- 🎯 Goal: Build a solid foundation and iterate on model performance with thoughtful experimentation.
